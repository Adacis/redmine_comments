Redmine Comments plugin
=======================

This plugin improves private notes in Redmine issues.
You can manage private notes visibility through roles and permissions.
A typical usage for an tech organization is to allow staff users to see/edit comments, but not lambda users.

The plugin requires Redmine version 2.5.0 or higher.

Private comments have been added in Redmine 2.2.0 and this plugin was originally made for Redmine < 2.1.0.
It now uses Redmine's default feature and old plugin's comments are automatically migrated to the standard Redmine feature.
See http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554 for more informations.
