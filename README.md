Redmine Comments plugin
=======================

This plugin adds private comments in Redmine issues. You can manage comments
visibility through roles and permissions. A typical usage for an tech
organization is to allow staff users to see/edit comments, but not lambda
users.

The plugin requires Redmine version 2.1.0 or higher.

As private comments will be added in Redmine 2.2.0, this plugin's comments will
be migrated to the standard Redmine feature as soon as it's released as stable.
See http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554 for more informations.
