Redmine Comments plugin
=======================

This plugin adds private comments in Redmine issues. You can manage comments
visibility through roles and permissions. A typical usage for an tech
organization is to allow staff users to see/edit comments, but not lambda
users.

The plugin requires Redmine version 2.1.0 or higher.

Private comments have been added in Redmine 2.2.0. This plugin continues to work
with Redmine 2.2.x and Redmine 2.3.x but it's only useful if you really don't
want to use Redmine's default feature, or if you upgrade from Redmine 2.1.x.
This plugin's comments will probably be migrated to the standard Redmine feature
in the next few months.  See http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554 for more
informations.
